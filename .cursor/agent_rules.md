You are implementing the project defined in SPEC.md.

Rules:
1) No “AI” comments or meta references in code.
2) Modular code, clear boundaries, small files.
3) Fix root causes. Avoid patchy defensive code.
4) Human-like comments: explain intent and decisions.
5) All external services through provider interfaces.
6) Configuration via env vars, no hard-coded secrets.
7) Keep deployability: Render + Supabase defaults.
8) Update SPEC.md if behavior changes.
